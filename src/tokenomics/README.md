#### What is the cap of the $TANGO token?

There is no hard cap of TANGO yet, but one may be put into place in the future.

#### Does the $TANGO token have any burn?

No not at at this time - but will be implemented in the future.
We will implement Tango burning tools in the near future through launchpad, lotteries, lending, etc.

#### How does $TANGO enter into circulation?

New Tango is created at 100 Tango per block for tokens that are staked in the farms on <https://tangoswap.cash/farm>
After 2 weeks with 100 Tango per block the emission will drop 10 Tango per block per day, until it reaches 10 Tango per block in perpetuity.
This will be reduced to 10 Tango per block after approximately two weeks from launch.
