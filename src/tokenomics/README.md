# Tokenomics

---
- TANGO is not pre-mined, nor is it pre-sale.

- 10 new TANGO is created per block for tokens that are staked in the farms on <https://tangoswap.cash/farm>. The first two weeks of launch will have a 10x bonus.

- 10% of all newly created TANGO is sent to TangoSwap.Cash's dev wallet.

- 0.05% of the exchange fees are awarded to holders of the xTANGO token.

- **Burning:** 0.05% of SmartSwap fees are use to buy and burn TANGO.

### What is the cap of the $TANGO token?

There is no hard cap of TANGO yet, but one may be put into place in the future.

The burning mechanisms reduce the circulating TANGO, making it scarce and even **deflationary**.

--
#### Does the $TANGO token have any burn?
All SmartSwap fees are automatically used to **buy and burn** TANGO.
- Burn address: 0x0000000000000000000000626c61636b686f6c65

#### How does burning improve TANGO's tokenomics?
TANGO has a fixed emission of 10 TANGO per block, if the burning of TANGO exceeds 10 TANGO per block this would make **TANGO deflationary**.
In the future, more burning mechanisms will be added to continue improving the TANGO tokenomics.

### How does $TANGO enter into circulation?

New TANGO is created at 100 TANGO per block for tokens that are staked in the farms on <https://tangoswap.cash/farm>

This will be reduced to 10 TANGO per block after approximately two weeks from launch. 

SmartSwap <https://smartswap.fi/> fees are automatically used to buy and burn TANGO.
