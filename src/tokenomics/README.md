# Tokenomics

---
- TANGO is not pre-mined, nor is it pre-sale.

- 10 new TANGO is created per block for tokens that are staked in the farms on <https://tangoswap.cash/farm>. The first two weeks of launch will have a 10x bonus.

- Since the Tango v2 upgrade (July 1, 2022), 0.1 Tango **less per block** per month is issued. In 100 months TANGO will no longer be issued.

- 1 TANGO per block is created and sent to TangoSwap Treasury.

- 0.05% of the exchange fees are awarded to holders of the xTANGO token.

- **Burning:** 0.05% of SmartSwap fees are use to buy and burn TANGO.

### What is the cap of the $TANGO token?

TANGO issuance is reduced monthly by 0.1 TANGO per block. This means that in 100 months the emission per block would drop from 10 to 0. However, even with an emission of 0, the various burning mechanisms would reduce the supply in circulation.

The burning mechanisms reduce the circulating TANGO, making it scarce and even deflationary.

#### How does burning improve TANGO's tokenomics?
$TANGO has a initial emission of 10 TANGO per block, and thanks to TangoV2 (same token) the **emission is reduced** by 0.1 tango per month,  that mean in 100 months there will be no more $TANGO emission for LP. 
If the burning of TANGO is greater than the emission per block this would make **TANGO deflationary**.
In the future, more burning mechanisms will be added to continue improving the TANGO tokenomics.

### How does $TANGO enter into circulation?

New TANGO is created at 100 TANGO per block for tokens that are staked in the farms on <https://tangoswap.cash/farm>

This will be reduced to 10 TANGO per block after approximately two weeks from launch. 

Since July 1, 2022, Tango issuance begins to reduce by 0.1 $TANGO per block each month. In 100 minus there is no more $TANGO issuance.

SmartSwap <https://smartswap.fi/> fees are automatically used to buy and burn TANGO.

- Thanks to SmartSwap (DEX Aggregator) TANGO has a new application as a utility token, which is located in the SmartSwap Liquidity Protocol where it is used as a connector to achieve high efficiency routing.
- All SmartSwap fees are automatically used to buy and burn TANGO, increasing its demand.
- TANGO becomes an increasingly scarce and demand token.
