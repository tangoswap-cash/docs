# Tokenomics

---
- TANGO is not pre-mined, nor is it pre-sale.

- 10 new TANGO is created per block for tokens that are staked in the farms on <https://tangoswap.cash/farm>. The first two weeks of launch will have a 10x bonus.

- 10% of all newly created TANGO is sent to TangoSwap.Cash's dev wallet.

- 0.05% of the exchange fees are awarded to holders of the xTANGO token.


#### What is the cap of the $TANGO token?

There is no hard cap of TANGO yet, but one may be put into place in the future.

The upcoming burning mechanisms will help reduce circulating TANGOs.

#### Does the $TANGO token have any burn?

We are working on adding burning mechanisms for the TANGO token

#### How does $TANGO enter into circulation?

New TANGO is created at 100 TANGO per block for tokens that are staked in the farms on <https://tangoswap.cash/farm>

This will be reduced to 10 TANGO per block after approximately two weeks from launch.

Our team is working on adding TANGO burning mechanisms, thus reducing TANGO in circulation.
