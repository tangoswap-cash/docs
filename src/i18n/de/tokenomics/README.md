- 0.05% of the exchange fees are awarded to holders of the xMIST token.

There is no hard cap of MIST yet, but one may be put into place in the future.

#### Does the $MIST token have any burn?

No not at at this time - but one may be implemented in the future.

#### How does $MIST enter into circulation?

New Mist is created at 1000 Mist per block for tokens that are staked in the farms on <https://app.mistswap.fi/farm>
