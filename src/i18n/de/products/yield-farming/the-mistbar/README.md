## What is xMIST?

xMIST is a token, similar to our MLP tokens, that you receive in exchange for staking MIST tokens in the MistBar. While holding the token, it will appreciate in value, as fees from our exchange platform are "served to the MistBar." The xMIST token is always worth more than a regular MIST token, because xMIST accrues value from platform fees. When users make trades on the MistSwap exchange a 0.3% fee is charged. 0.05% of this fee is added to the MistBar pool in the form of LP tokens. When the rewards contract is called (minimum once per day) all the LP tokens are sold for Mist (on MistSwap Exchange). The newly purchased Mist is then divided up proportionally between all of the xMIST holders in the pool, meaning their xMIST is now worth more MIST. Because of the way the rewards are generated, the price of xMIST will increase with the value of MIST, and the value of one xMIST will always be greater than the value of one MIST. Fees generated into the MistBar are vested for a period of time [see the Vesting FAQ].
